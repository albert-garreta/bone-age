"""
This file contains functions for working with the contours of bones provided 
in the json files (these files have been obtained privately and for the moment are not publicly available).
Each json file has the name <HAND_ID>.json. Such a file contains the bone contours of the hand given in
<HAND_ID>.png. A contour is a list of points.

Here we provide methods for: 
    - Extracting the contours from the json files,
    - Finding the diameter and the perimeter of a contour
    - Finding the distance between two contours
    - Detecting the type of contour: for each <HAND_ID>.json we also
    have a private .png file where bones have been colored with distinct colors
    depending on the type of bone (there are 5 types of bones in total). 
    
    See the `has_color` function.

    Given a hand id (e.g. 1712), gets all the bone contours provided in the corresponding json file
    (following the example, this would be 1712.json)
    for the hand. A contour is a list of points surrounding a bone. For each hand, this function
    returns a dictionary mapping the order of appearance of a contour in the json file, to the
    contour.

    NOTE: This function accepts (optionally) the dimensions of image <ID>.png as input
    because sometimes the contours have some coordinates which are off the image by one pixel,
    and thus they need to be clipped. If `hand_dimensions` is not provided then the function
    ignores this, but then one may get a `list index out of range` error later on.
